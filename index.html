    <h2>Artis Statment</h2>
    <p>The metaphor of this game is individual growth path. In order to enter next level, players have to avoid obstacles and jump to get points. This is similar to our lives. Every individual has to overcome the difficulties to survive and then earn something to make a better life. The game stars with the baby piggy jump to baby bottles to get points because this is the start point of every body. Unfortunately, the next level of this game has not been fully developed yet. I intent to create three genders and multiple occupations for players to customize their platform. The selection of gender will decide their characters, the selection of occupations will decide their points function. </p>
    <!-- <p>The concept of the game is to grow up by overcome difficulties. Everyone will face their personal challenges. The challenge in our life will move us in a new direction. The challenges that we face that help us grow and make us stronger.In the game, We used a piggy to imply human. The obstacles of strollers represents that the piggy is a newborn piggy. The baby piggy needs to jump over each stroller in order to grow up. It is kind of symbolic of a person's growth story.</p> -->
